# Tic-Tac-Toe-FireBase-Multiplayer-Start
Classic Tic Tac Toe game made using JavaScript and basic HTML &amp; CSS and added RealTime Database from FireBase to give Multiplayer Functionality.  I have used Javascript and basic HTML &amp; CSS to build ythis web application , I have integrated the Real Time Database from google Firebase to add the Multiplayer functionality.  #Real Time DataBase from Firebase  So when the player hosts a game a new key is generated and also a new game database is created in the firebase with the key so that the game between the two people playing the game with same key remains isolated from other games with different keys.  When the other player enters the key and joins the game he is added to the same database created through that key.  When the player clicks the boxes to mark the "X" or "O" the character is enterd into the firebase and then gets printed on the screen of both the player's screens. The game gets updated continuously because of the real time Database.
